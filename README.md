# homework-01 README

This is a homework assigment in which the goal is to take existing code from a html and a css file and clean up the existing code to make the code easier to read.  This is a common task for coders to do in order to make the code easier for other to read as well as to make search engines better repersent the webpage.

The html file had two types of changes that were made throughout the code.  The first change was the comments were added throughout the code to explain what each section of code does when the html file is opened in a web browser.  The second change was that all of the div tags were changed to other semantic tags that better described the what area of the webpage that the code contained within those tags pretained to.

In the css file some changes had to be made to the selector tags to match changes made to the semantic tag changes made in the html file.  Also, there were several areas in the css file where duplicate code was conslidated for easier readability.  All changes made in the css file were documented with comments.
